# final-project
In this project, me and my partner, Aiah Aly, decided to work on creating a Blackjack Game with a visual graphic. Although we tried to include an animation with the project within the deadline, we were not able to figure out the issue with PIL before the deadline passed, so we developed a simple game with just TKinter. The user may interact with the game through the terminal, and the graphics of the game will show on the application in real time.

Aiah worked on developing the skeleton for the game, as well as some of the TKinter, and I worked on finishing the TKinter, add,ing music and debugging the program.
